# Pull-to-Refresh Test: Tests pull-to-refresh functionality with loading indicator
# Verifies that pulling down triggers refresh and shows loading indicator
# NOTE: This test is agnostic - it works on any screen with pull-to-refresh
# This test does not launch the app or navigate - it should be called from other flows

# Trigger pull-to-refresh
- swipe:
    from:
      text: ".*Pagination list.*"
    direction: DOWN
    duration: 100

# Verify the news card still there after pull to refresh
- assertVisible: ".*News card.*"
