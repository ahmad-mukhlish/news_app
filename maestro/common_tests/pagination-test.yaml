# Pagination Test: Tests infinite scroll pagination with loading indicators
# Verifies that more articles load when scrolling to bottom
# NOTE: This test is agnostic - it works on any screen with scrollable news cards
# This test does not launch the app or navigate - it should be called from other flows

# Wait for articles to be visible
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible: ".*News card.*"
    timeout: 5000

# Test: Scroll down to trigger pagination
# Scroll multiple times to reach pagination threshold
